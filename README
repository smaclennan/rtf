qmail + rtf + bogofilter

I have three folders in my Maildir to handle spam: Spam, LearnSPAM,
and Ham.

My .qmail file is two lines and looks like this:

|/home/seanm/bin/rtf -b
./Maildir/

The ./Maildir/ is just to handle error conditions. If there are no
errors, rtf returns 99.

So spam will get redirected to the Spam folder and normal mail is
handled normally.

If an email is marked as ham but is really spam, I move the email to
the LearnSPAM folder.

If an email is marked as spam, but it really ham, I copy (not move)
the email to the Ham folder.

The daemon `learnem' runs and handles processing the .LearnSPAM and
.Ham directories.
