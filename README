qmail + rtf + bogofilter

I have three folders in my Maildir to handle spam: Spam, LearnSPAM,
and Ham. I also have one folder to handle emails I am ignoring:
Ignore.

My .qmail file is two lines and looks like this:

|/home/seanm/bin/rtf -b
./Maildir/

The ./Maildir/ is just to handle error conditions. If there are no
errors, rtf returns 99.

Spam is moved to the Spam directory and marked as read.

If an email is marked as ham but is really spam, I move the email to
the LearnSPAM folder.

If an email is marked as spam, but it really ham, I copy (not move)
the email to the Ham folder.

The daemon `learnem' runs and handles processing the .LearnSPAM and
.Ham directories.

The Ignore directory is email from legitimate sources, such as stores
I have purchased from, that I really don't care about. So I move them
into an Ignore directory and mark them read. After a week, they are
deleted.
