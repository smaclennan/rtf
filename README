qmail + rtf
-----------

I have two folders in my Maildir to handle spam: Spam and Drop. You
don't need two, the dropped files can go in Spam.

I also have one folder to handle emails I am ignoring. The Ignore
directory is email from legitimate sources, such as stores I have
purchased from, that I really don't care about. So I move them into an
Ignore directory and mark them read. After a week, they are deleted.

My .qmail file is two lines and looks like this:

|/usr/bin/rtf -aadl /home/seanm/.bogofilter/rtf.log
./Maildir/

The ./Maildir/ is just to handle error conditions. If there are no
errors, rtf returns 99 and the Maildir rule is skipped.


qmail + rtf + bogofilter
------------------------

For bogofilter I add two more folders: LearnSPAM, and Ham.

My .qmail file also has the 'b' option to enable bogofilter.

|/usr/bin/rtf -aabdl /home/seanm/.bogofilter/rtf.log
./Maildir/

If an email is marked as ham but is really spam, I move the email to
the LearnSPAM folder.

If an email is marked as spam, but it really ham, I copy (not move)
the email to the Ham folder.

The daemon `learnem' runs and handles processing the LearnSPAM and
Ham directories.
